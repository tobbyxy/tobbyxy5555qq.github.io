## What do you want to learn today?

I am trying to learn how to blog on github using github pages and fastai


## Apply Function

Apply function comes in when you want to write multiple for loops or while loops.

1. Lapply loops through a list 
2. applies a function on each individual elements of that list.
3. it always returns a list.

## noticed:

1. if you have a list that includes different types of data structure i.e dataframe and list, Lapply won't function
2. Using loop function, ensure that all the elements you are looping through are of equal dimension


## Regular Expression summary

1. Using filter and grep will return all rows and location of dataframe
2. 



And you can include links, like this [link to fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai). Posts will appear after this file.
